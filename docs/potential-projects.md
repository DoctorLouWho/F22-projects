# F22-projects

Here are all the potential projects for Fall 2022.
1. It is possible to change the specific goals of a project _after_ a team is formed. But the theme should not be altered.
1. All teams should aim to deploy your work somewhere, e.g. mobile app, website, extension, etc.
1. Each project should have a public GitHub repository under the club.
1. Some projects are labeled as "beginner friendly" because they are low floor high ceiling, meaning that it is relatively easy to build something that works minimally (e.g. very vague goals). But you are highly encouraged to improve it continuously.
